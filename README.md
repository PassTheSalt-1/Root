Hello! 

This is meant to be a fun, expanding scope, curiosity following project. I am honing my programming skill while also learning about web developlment and architecture. 

So far, I have implemented basic configurations of:
flask
gunicorn
nginx

I plan to implement some kind of encryption for the web traffic through the proxy, but without a public domain I would need to do research as I don't think I can use Let's Encrypt.
