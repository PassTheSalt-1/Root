Hello! 

This is meant to be a fun, expanding scope, curiosity following project. I am honing my programming skill while also learning about web developlment and architecture. 

Languages used: Python, JSON, HTML, CSS, eventually JavaScript, and possible some Rust if I can find a way to use it. (I want to go through the book of Rust too!)

So far, I have implemented basic configurations of flask, gunicorn, nginx and validated that the flask app is flowing all the way through the nginx on the web-interface.

I plan to implement some kind of encryption for the web traffic through the proxy, but without a public domain I would need to do research as I don't think I can use Let's Encrypt.
